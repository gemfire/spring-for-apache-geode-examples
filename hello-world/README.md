# Hello, World! Code Example

The *Hello, World!* example app is a small and simple application that was created to test your various environment setups. When you run the app the first time, it simulates a query to a backend data source.  Then, on subsequent queries for that data, it demonstrates how caching that data can improve your apps read performance.
